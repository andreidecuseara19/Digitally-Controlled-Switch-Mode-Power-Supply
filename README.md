# Digitally-Controlled-Switch-Mode-Power-Supply
This diploma project outlines the design and implementation of a digitally controlled switch-mode power supply using synchronous buck converter topology. The primary objective was to develop a compact, efficient, and user-programmable DC voltage source, combining the high-efficiency characteristics of switch-mode converters and the precision and flexibility of digital control.

The circuit uses a microcontroller board (Arduino Mega), a digital-to-analog converter (MCP4725), a KY-040 rotary encoder for the real-time adjustment of the output voltage and a compact switching converter circuit using MP2307 which was modified. Voltage and current readings were made using a STEVAL-DIGAFEV1 board, which features a high-precision monitoring IC (TSC1641), and are displayed on an I2C LCD.
